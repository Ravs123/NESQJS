1)Filter:Filter ages array which are 21 and above/over 
2)Filere : Filter 'Retail' Company
3) filter : Filter companies array which are started in 80's
4)filer : Filter companies that lasted more than 10years 
5)Filter : Employee Array who are 'developer'

7)Filter : Filter Age array , find  odd and even values


1)map: map() method create new array from the existing/current array 
2)Create array of compaines names 
3)Map() : Find the employee  Designation and salary

---------------------Common Programming practical question --------------------------
--Challenge 1: REVERSE A String 
Return a string in reverse order 
Ex: reverString('hello')==='olleh'

--Challenge 2 : Validate a Palindrome 
return true if palindrome or if not , return false 
ex: isPalindrome('racecare')==true , is palindrome and ('hello')===false 

--challenge 3: Reverse an integer 
return an interger in reverse 
ex: reverseInt(521)===125

--Challenge 4: Capitalize letters
Return a string with the first letter of every word capitalized 
ex capitalizeLetter('i love javascript')=== I LOVE JAVASCRIPT


--Write a JavaScript program to get the difference between a given number and 13, if the number is greater 
than 13 return double the absolute difference.

--Area of a square root  A=/s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)

_)Difference between rest operator and spread operator 
Note:JavaScript uses three dots (...) for both the rest and spread operators. 
     But these two operators are not the same.

_)What Is the Spread Operator and How Does spread work in JavaScript?
The spread operator (...) helps you expand iterables into individual elements.
Note: A spread operator is effective only when used within array literals, function calls, 
or initialized properties objects.

Main Question: Get the passengers' names using the data provided 
Bonus Part (a)- Return vegetarians/vegans
Bonus Part (b)- Sort passengers by the number of connected flights in descending order

The Data
To solve the puzzles, you're expected to use the data inside the following array of objects in practical ways.

const passengers = [
    {
      id: 1,
      passengerName: "Freddie Mercury",
      isVegetarianOrVegan: false,
      connectedFlights: 2,
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      passengerName: "Amy Winehouse",
      isVegetarianOrVegan: true,
      connectedFlights: 4,
    },
      {
      id: 3,
      passengerName: "Kurt Cobain",
      isVegetarianOrVegan: true,
      connectedFlights: 3,
    },
       {
      id: 3,
      passengerName: "Michael Jackson",
      isVegetarianOrVegan: true,
      connectedFlights: 1,
    },
  ];

-- a filter function. Takes an input, and returns true/false from it.

const objArray = [{a: 1, b: 2}, {a: 4, b: 5}, {a: 8, b: 9}];

-)Convert the number to a string, using the spread operator (...) to build an array. 

--using array.every(): find if all 'age' is >=80 
The every() method tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function. 
It returns a Boolean value.

__ 4 Ways to Swap Variables in JavaScript?

//using destructuring assignment
let a = 1;
let b = 2;

[a, b] = [b, a];

console.log(a); // => 2
console.log(b); // => 1


// addition and subtraction operator
let a = 1;
let b = 2;

a = a + b;
b = a - b;
a = a - b;

console.log(a); // => 2
console.log(b); // => 1

-)Square Root 
-)SetTimeOut/SetTimeInterval 
-)Second largest value from the Array 
-)Convert all the array items to uppercase:
-)Print Prime Number :[only odd numbers/only even numbers]
-)checking if a string contains a work 'software' in a given string 'I am a software Developer'
